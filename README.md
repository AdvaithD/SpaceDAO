## Inspiration
As we enter this 21st century we enter also a new era in space. Emerging technologies offer unprecedented new access to a realm of possibilities once limited to the largest superpower nations. We stand on the brink of a new space development boom to rival that of the information revolution. To pursue life in space is to learn to go from dirt, rocks, and sunlight to a sustainable middle-class standard of living using tools on the scale of home appliances. There is virtually nothing about life on Earth these capabilities would not change in parallel. To that end, we call for the creation of the first decentralized autonomous space agency as an open global venture.

## What it does
- Supporters contribute ETH into the Space DAO, and get 3x STC in their wallet, and 1x STC is deposited into a fundPool
- Supporters with at least 1 STC can elect people to the Space Council, who manages the fundPool (multisig wallet)
- STC from the fundPool is allocated as bounties to new Project contracts, which are essentially a “request for proposals”
- Mission Designers pay entry fee to submit solutions to win the Project bounties
- Qualified Peer Reviewers will review the solutions and grade them (1-4)
- Proposal with highest average grade wins bounty
- Space Council can validate or veto the winning solution
